```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Problem 1

*Load IRIS data from the tidyverse*

```{r}
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

The data appears to be measurements of individual iris flowers (petal and sepal lengths and widths to the nearest 10th of a unit). Included also are species names.

*Address 2 cases: For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the mean of non-missing values
For character variables, you should fill in missing values with "virginica." Write a function that takes a vector as an argument; replaces missing values using the rules defined above; and returns the resulting vector. Apply this function to the columns of iris_with_missing using a map statement.*

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
